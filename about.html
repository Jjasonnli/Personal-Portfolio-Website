    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="introduction">
        Hello! I'm Jason Li. I am in my second year at Drexel University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.
        <br><br>
        I created this website to build myself a portfolio and as a way to improve my web development skills. I aim to add more content as I gain<br>
        more experience and build projects I am passionate about. 
        <br><br>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy playing badminton with friends, listening to music, going to the gym, and playing video games.
    </p>
